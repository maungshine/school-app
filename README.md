cs50 final project
 My final project is a web application which is sort of a school website.An admin account is created for school admins. Student cannot
create accounts by themselves. They have to apply for the program they are interested in, providing required information and document.
Admins can monitor and review the student applications and if a student meet the requirements,the school can accept the application.Once a
student is accepted, a student account is created for him/her and an automated email containing congratulations message and student account
information is sent to him/her.Now students can login to their accounts. After logging in their accounts, they can see the anouncements
from their school, update their information and profiles and change their account passwords. Admins can also search for students
by name or id, update student and applicant information, delete a student or an applicant, create posts for anouncment, edit posts and
delete posts.If an admin or a student forget his/her password, he/she request a password reset link by providing his/her email. After
requesting, an email with a link via which they can reset their password is sent to their email inbox.In this way, a school can manage
their student information and applications, and make anouncements to students.

    I used python with flask framework, html, css and bootstrap for this web app.
